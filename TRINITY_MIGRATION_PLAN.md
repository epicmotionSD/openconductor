### 2. Technical Migration Process

#### Data Migration Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# migrate-user-data.sh

echo "üîÑ Migrating OpenConductor user data to Trinity Agent Platform..."

# Export user accounts

echo "‚úÖ User data migration complete"
```

#### Workflow Transformation Logic
```typescript
// Transform MCP workflows to Trinity Agent automations
function transformWorkflow(mcpWorkflow: any): TrinityWorkflow {
  // Analyze workflow purpose and map to appropriate Trinity Agent
  const agentType = detectAgentType(mcpWorkflow);
  
  // Convert MCP steps to Trinity Agent automation
  const trinitySteps = mcpWorkflow.steps.map(step => ({
    ...step,
    agentEnhanced: true,
    aiDecisionPoint: inferDecisionPoints(step)
  }));

  return {
    id: `trinity-${mcpWorkflow.id}`,
    agentType,
    name: `AI-Enhanced ${mcpWorkflow.name}`,
    steps: trinitySteps,
    migrationSource: 'openconductor'
