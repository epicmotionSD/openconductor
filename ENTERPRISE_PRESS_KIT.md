## 👤 **Founder Story**

OpenConductor was built by a **self-taught railroad electrician** who transformed industrial AI agent orchestration into enterprise developer infrastructure.

*"I spent 2 hours tracing a faulty IGBT inverter through 40-year-old locomotive schematics. So I built an AI agent to do it in 10 minutes. That agent uses 5 MCP servers, but setting them up took 3 days. So I built an enterprise platform to make it take 3 minutes - for everyone."*

**Background:**
- No computer science degree
- Self-taught developer with industrial automation expertise
- Railroad industry professional building AI tools for locomotive diagnostics
- Transformed personal pain point into enterprise platform solution
