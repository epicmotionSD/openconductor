Hey r/[SUBREDDIT],

Wanted to share some exciting news and ask for community help:

**OpenConductor just hit 70+ downloads** on npm without any marketing - just developers finding it organically. This is incredible validation that the MCP ecosystem needs better tooling.

**What is OpenConductor?** The npm for MCP servers - discover and install AI agent tools with a single command instead of manual config editing.

**We're launching Saturday on Product Hunt** and would love early user testimonials to help other developers discover this.

**If you've tried OpenConductor:**
- Share your experience at: https://openconductor.ai/feedback  
- Or just comment here with your thoughts!

**Early user quotes we've received:**
> "Finally, professional tooling for AI agents"
> "Installation went from 30 minutes to 30 seconds"

**For those who haven't tried it:**
```bash
npm install -g @openconductor/cli
openconductor discover "memory"
openconductor install openmemory
```

Thoughts? Experiences? We're all ears!

Founder here - we just hit 70+ organic downloads before any official launch, which is incredible validation that developers need better MCP tooling.

Current experience: Find MCP server on GitHub → Copy config to claude_desktop_config.json → Debug port conflicts → Restart Claude → Hope it works

OpenConductor experience: `openconductor install openmemory` → Done.

We're launching Saturday on Product Hunt. If you've tried the CLI, we'd love your feedback at https://openconductor.ai/feedback

The "npm for MCP servers" concept seems to resonate - would love HN's thoughts on the approach.
