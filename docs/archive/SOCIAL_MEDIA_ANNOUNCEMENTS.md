### Tweet 4 - Technical Details
```
Built both with:

✅ TypeScript (full type safety)
✅ Smart caching (respects rate limits)
✅ Zero config (works out of the box)
✅ Comprehensive docs
✅ MIT licensed

690 lines (Registry) + 760 lines (SportIntel) = 1,450 LOC total

Open source on GitHub 👇

```

### Tweet 5 - Why This Matters
```
Why 2 servers?

Registry MCP = B2D (developers)
→ Network effects for ecosystem growth

SportIntel = B2C (sports fans)
→ $70B market, freemium revenue

Shows MCP works for EVERYONE, not just devs

This is the future of AI interfaces 🚀

## 📘 LinkedIn Post

### Professional Version
```
I just published two Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that demonstrate the versatility of Anthropic's new platform.

**OpenConductor Registry MCP**
The first "meta-MCP" server - helping Claude discover other MCP servers conversationally. Instead of hunting through documentation, users can ask "Show me database servers" and get instant, formatted results with installation instructions.

**SportIntel MCP**
Live sports intelligence for NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, and MLS. Brings real-time scores, standings, and team data directly into Claude conversations, enabling AI-powered analysis without context switching.

**Why Two Servers?**
This portfolio approach demonstrates MCP's potential across different markets:
- Registry targets developers (B2D) with ecosystem discovery
- SportIntel targets consumers (B2C) in the $70B+ sports market

Both are production-ready, fully documented, and available on npm today.

Key technical highlights:
✅ TypeScript with full type safety
✅ Intelligent caching for API rate limiting
✅ Comprehensive documentation
✅ Zero-configuration installation
✅ MIT licensed

Built in 5 hours for the Anthropic Model Context Protocol Challenge.

Try them:
→ npm install -g @openconductor/mcp-registry
→ npm install -g @openconductor/sportintel

### r/ClaudeAI
**Title**: I built 2 MCP servers for Claude: Server discovery + Live sports data

```
Hey r/ClaudeAI! I just published two MCP servers for the Anthropic challenge and wanted to share them with the community.

**OpenConductor Registry MCP** - [npmjs.com/package/@openconductor/mcp-registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openconductor/mcp-registry)

The first "meta" MCP server. Instead of manually browsing GitHub for MCP servers, just ask Claude:
- "Show me database-related MCP servers"
- "What are the trending MCP servers?"
- "Get details about the github server"

It has access to 120+ validated MCP servers and gives you instant install instructions.

**SportIntel MCP** - [npmjs.com/package/@openconductor/sportintel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openconductor/sportintel)

Live sports data directly in Claude:
- NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, MLS scores
- League standings
- Team search
- AI-powered analysis

Perfect for fantasy sports or just checking last night's game without leaving your workflow.

**Install both:**
```
npm install -g @openconductor/mcp-registry @openconductor/sportintel
```

Both are fully open source, MIT licensed, and took about 5 hours total to build. Happy to answer questions!

[Demo videos attached]
```

### r/NBA (SportIntel Focus)
**Title**: I made an AI tool to get live NBA scores and standings in Claude

```
Hey r/NBA! Built a tool that lets you check NBA scores and standings directly in Claude AI without switching apps.

**What it does:**
- Live game scores with real-time updates
- Full league standings by division
- Team search and info
- Works with Claude's AI for analysis (like "which teams are playoff-bound?")

**How to use:**
1. Install: `npm install -g @openconductor/sportintel`
2. Configure Claude Desktop (instructions in README)
3. Ask: "What are today's NBA scores?"

Also works for NFL, MLB, NHL, and MLS.

Built it for Anthropic's MCP Challenge. Completely free, open source.

npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openconductor/sportintel
```

### r/LocalLLaMA
**Title**: Built 2 MCP servers in 5 hours - Meta discovery + Sports data

```
Sharing two MCP servers I built for the Anthropic challenge:

**1. OpenConductor Registry MCP**
Meta-MCP server for discovering other servers. LLM can search 120+ MCP servers, get details, installation instructions - all conversationally.

**2. SportIntel**
Live sports data (ESPN API) + standings + team info for NBA/NFL/MLB/NHL/MLS with smart caching.

**Tech stack:**
- TypeScript + MCP SDK
- Zod validation
- In-memory caching (no Redis needed)
- ESPN public APIs (no keys required)

**Combined:** ~1,450 LOC, fully typed, comprehensive docs.

Interesting pattern: Registry creates network effects for ecosystem discovery. SportIntel shows MCP works beyond dev tools.

Both MIT licensed on npm:
- @openconductor/mcp-registry
- @openconductor/sportintel

Feedback welcome! Especially interested in performance/caching optimizations.
