What does "70+ organic downloads" mean?

❌ No marketing
❌ No outreach  
❌ No announcements
✅ Just developers solving their own problems

Real product-market fit looks like this. 2/8

---

The problem we solve:

Before: Find MCP server on GitHub → Copy config to claude_desktop_config.json → Debug port conflicts → Restart Claude → Hope it works 😅

After: `openconductor install openmemory` → Done ✨ 3/8

---

Early user feedback:
💬 "Finally, professional tooling for AI agents"
💬 "Installation went from 30 minutes to 30 seconds"  
💬 "Game-changer for our AI workflow"
💬 "This is what I've been waiting for"

The need is real. 4/8

Built by a self-taught railroad electrician 🚂

I needed to orchestrate AI agents for locomotive diagnostics. Setting up 5 MCP servers took 3 days.

OpenConductor makes it take 3 minutes.

Background doesn't matter. Solutions do. 5/8

---

The modern AI stack:
✅ Deploy with Vercel
✅ Build with v0  
✅ Store with Supabase
✅ Manage content with BaseHub
❌ AI agents in isolation

OpenConductor completes the stack. 6/8

---

Why this matters:

70+ downloads = 70+ developers who needed this solution
Zero marketing = Authentic product-market fit  
Saturday launch = Community validation
Open source = Built for developers, by developers 7/8

🚀 Launch Day: OpenConductor is live on Product Hunt!

What started as solving my own problem as a railroad electrician has become something 70+ developers discovered organically.

The problem: AI agents are powerful but isolated from modern development workflows. 

You deploy with Vercel, build with v0, store data in Supabase - but AI agents require manual config files and debugging.

OpenConductor bridges this gap. One command installs any MCP server:

```bash
openconductor install postgresql-mcp
```

That's it. Professional tooling for AI infrastructure.

70+ developers found us through npm searches before any announcement. That's product-market fit you can't manufacture.

The future of AI development is orchestrated, not isolated.

### **Founder Story Post**
```
Sometimes the best innovations come from unexpected places.

I'm not a traditional software engineer - I'm a railroad electrician who learned to code out of necessity.

When I needed AI agents to help with locomotive diagnostics, setting up 5 MCP servers took me 3 days of config file debugging.

So I built OpenConductor to make it take 3 minutes.

70+ developers found and installed it organically before we even launched. Zero marketing. Just solving real problems.

Today we're on Product Hunt. Tomorrow we're changing how developers think about AI infrastructure.

🚀 My side project just hit 70+ organic downloads and launched on Product Hunt!

**What it is:** OpenConductor - the npm for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers

**The problem:** Setting up AI agent tools requires manual config file editing, port debugging, and lots of frustration

**The solution:** `openconductor install [server-name]` - done.

**The validation:** 70+ developers found and installed it organically through npm searches before any marketing. Zero outreach. Just solving problems.

**Background:** I'm a railroad electrician who learned to code because I needed AI agents for locomotive diagnostics. Traditional dev tools didn't fit my workflow.

**Today:** Live on Product Hunt and climbing!

Try it:
```bash
npm install -g @openconductor/cli
openconductor install openmemory
```

[D] OpenConductor: npm for MCP servers - 70+ organic downloads before launch

Posted this on Product Hunt today after discovering 70+ developers found us organically.

**Problem:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are powerful but setup is painful. Manual config files, port conflicts, debugging sessions.

**Solution:** One-command installation like npm:
- `openconductor discover "database"`  
- `openconductor install postgresql-mcp`
- Ready to use in Claude/other MCP clients

**Validation:** 70+ npm downloads with zero marketing. Developers actively searching for better MCP tooling.

**Technical details:**
- CLI built in TypeScript  
- Registry API with PostgreSQL backend
- Auto-syncs 60+ curated MCP servers from GitHub
- Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- MIT licensed

The MCP ecosystem is exploding but lacks professional tooling. OpenConductor bridges that gap.
