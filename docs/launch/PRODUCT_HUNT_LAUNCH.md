### **Maker Comment**
"I'm a railroad electrician who built AI agents to diagnose $10M locomotives. Setting up 5 MCP servers took 3 days. So I built OpenConductor to make it take 3 minutes.

But then I realized something bigger: developers using Vercel, v0, and Supabase need AI agents that integrate with their professional workflows, not legacy tooling.

OpenConductor evolved from tool discovery to ecosystem orchestration. Deploy agents alongside your components with the same professionalism as your entire stack.

We're not just the npm for AI agents—we're the platform layer that completes the modern AI development workflow."
