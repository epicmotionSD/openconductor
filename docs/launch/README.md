## Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "I don't have a good profile picture"**
- Use a professional headshot or a clean avatar
- Canva has free avatar creators
- Consistency across platforms matters more than perfection

**Issue: "My screenshots aren't pretty enough"**
- Terminal screenshots are fine - developers appreciate authenticity
- Focus on clarity over beauty
- Show real functionality, not mock-ups

**Issue: "I'm not good at writing copy"**
- Use the templates in the guides
- Be authentic - your story is unique
- Ask for feedback from friends
- Simple and clear beats clever and complex

**Issue: "What if I don't get upvotes?"**
- You have 600+ real users - share with them
- Engage more in comments - interaction drives visibility
- Share demo content on other platforms
- Remember: organic growth already validates PMF

**Issue: "I can't stay up for 12:01 AM PST"**
- Set an alarm for 15 minutes
- Post your maker comment and first tweet
- Go back to sleep if needed
- Most traffic is 6 AM - 9 PM PST anyway
