## 🗣️ **Key Quotes for Comments**

### **Founder Story**
*"I'm a self-taught railroad electrician who needed to orchestrate AI agents for locomotive diagnostics. Setting up 5 MCP servers took 3 days. OpenConductor makes it take 3 minutes. 70+ developers found us organically - that's validation you can't fake."*

### **Problem Statement**
*"You deploy with Vercel, build with v0, store data in Supabase - but AI agents live in isolation. OpenConductor is the missing orchestration layer that completes your modern AI stack."*

### **Early Adoption**
*"70+ developers discovered OpenConductor organically through npm searches and GitHub. Zero marketing. Zero outreach. Just developers solving their own pain points. That's the strongest product-market fit signal we could ask for."*

## 💬 **Comment Responses Strategy**

### **When someone asks about MCP:**
*"MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI agents use tools like databases, filesystems, APIs. Think of it as 'plugins for AI.' The problem? Each server requires manual config. OpenConductor makes it as easy as npm install."*

### **When someone compares to alternatives:**
*"Great question! Unlike manual config or other tools, OpenConductor is built specifically for the modern AI stack. It's the npm for MCP servers - 70+ developers found us organically, proving the need is real."*

### **When someone asks about pricing:**
*"Free for all developers! Core platform is completely free. We have Pro features for teams and Enterprise for organizations, but the CLI and basic platform cost nothing."*

🚀 Exciting launch day! OpenConductor is live on Product Hunt.

That's validation you can't manufacture.
