🧵 We just solved the MCP Server Discovery Problem

Most devs use 2-3 MCP servers. There are 127+.

Why? Because discovery is broken.

Introducing OpenConductor - the npm for MCP servers.

**PH Launch Comment:**
```
Hey PH! 👋

Creator here. Built OpenConductor to solve MCP server discovery.

I'm a railroad electrician (not a typical SWE) who needed to 
orchestrate 5+ AI agents to troubleshoot locomotive schematics.

Manual setup took days. Now it's one command.

Happy to answer questions! Thanks for checking it out 🙏
