## 👤 **Founder Story**

OpenConductor was built by a **self-taught railroad electrician** who needed to orchestrate multiple AI agents for locomotive diagnostics.

*"I spent 2 hours tracing a faulty IGBT inverter through 40-year-old schematics. So I built an AI agent to do it in 10 minutes. But setting up 5 MCP servers took 3 days. So I built OpenConductor to make it take 3 minutes."*

**Background:**
- No computer science degree
- Self-taught developer
- Railroad industry professional
- Builds AI tools for industrial applications
