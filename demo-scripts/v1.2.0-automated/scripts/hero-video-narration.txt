What if you could transform Claude into a specialized AI assistant in 10 seconds instead of 30 minutes? OpenConductor v1.2.0 makes it possible.

## Scene 2: scene-02-problem

Setting up MCP servers used to mean hunting through GitHub, manually editing JSON configs, wrestling with syntax errors, and losing 30 minutes of your day. And that's if everything works.

## Scene 3: scene-03-solution

Version 1.2.0 introduces Stacks - pre-configured AI workflows that bundle the right servers with specialized system prompts. No configuration, no guesswork, just instant value.
