```
I'll help you create a migration for OAuth authentication. Let me first check your existing users table structure.

[Uses PostgreSQL server]
Querying users table schema...

I can see your current users table has:
- id (UUID primary key)
- email (unique)
- password_hash
- created_at
- updated_at

For OAuth support, I'll create a migration that:
1. Adds provider and provider_id columns
2. Makes password_hash nullable (for OAuth-only users)
3. Adds a unique constraint on (provider, provider_id)
4. Maintains backward compatibility

Here's the migration:

[Shows SQL migration code]

I've stored this migration pattern in memory for future auth-related changes. Would you like me to also create the OAuth service layer?
```
