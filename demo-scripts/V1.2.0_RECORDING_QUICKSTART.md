---

## ⚡ 30-Minute Setup Checklist

### Step 1: Environment Prep (5 minutes)

**Terminal Setup**:
```bash
# Clean your shell history
history -c

# Set a clean prompt
export PS1="\$ "

# Increase font size for recording
# Terminal → Preferences → Profiles → Text
# Font: Monaco 18pt (or larger)

# Use dark theme
# Terminal → Preferences → Profiles → Basic
# Background: Black, Text: Green or White
```

**Desktop Cleanup**:
```bash
# macOS: Hide desktop icons
defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false
killall Finder

# Disable notifications
# System Preferences → Notifications → Turn on Do Not Disturb
```

**Claude Desktop**:
- [ ] Clear conversation history (start fresh)
- [ ] Use dark theme (Settings → Appearance)
- [ ] Maximize window (full screen)
- [ ] Close all other apps

---

### Step 2: Install Recording Software (10 minutes)

**macOS - QuickTime (Easiest)**:
1. Already installed ✓
2. Open QuickTime Player
3. File → New Screen Recording
4. Click Options:
   - Microphone: Select your mic
   - Quality: Maximum
   - Show Mouse Clicks: Off (we'll add in post)
5. Ready to record

**macOS/Windows/Linux - OBS Studio (Professional)**:
```bash
# macOS
brew install --cask obs

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install obs-studio

# Windows
# Download from obsproject.com
```

**OBS Setup**:
1. Open OBS Studio
2. Create New Scene: "Claude Demo"
3. Add Source → Display Capture (macOS) or Window Capture (Windows/Linux)
4. Settings → Video:
   - Base Resolution: 1920x1080
   - Output Resolution: 1920x1080
   - FPS: 30
5. Settings → Output:
   - Recording Format: mp4
   - Encoder: x264
   - Video Bitrate: 10000 Kbps
6. Settings → Audio:
   - Desktop Audio: Disabled (we want silence during screen recording)
   - Mic/Auxiliary: Your microphone
7. Click "Start Recording" to test (record 10 seconds, verify quality)

---

### Step 3: Verify OpenConductor Stack Install Works (5 minutes)

**Critical: Test the actual install before recording!**

```bash
# Ensure CLI is latest version
npm install -g @openconductor/cli

# Verify version
openconductor --version
# Should show: 1.2.0 or higher

# Test stack list command
openconductor stack list
# Should show beautiful table with 3 stacks

# DO NOT install a stack yet (save for recording)
# But verify the command works
openconductor stack show coder
# Should display coder stack details
```

**If anything fails, fix it now before recording!**

---

### Step 4: Prepare Voiceover Script (10 minutes)

**Print or have on second monitor**:
- Open [V1.2.0_PRODUCTION_SCRIPTS.md](V1.2.0_PRODUCTION_SCRIPTS.md)
- Find "VIDEO 1: Hero Launch Video"
- Read through voiceover lines
- Practice once (get comfortable with pacing)
- Mark any lines that feel awkward (rewrite in your own voice)

**Pro Tip**: Record voiceover separately, sync in post-production. This gives you:
- Better audio quality (quiet room, professional mic)
- Ability to re-record individual lines
- Easier editing (speed up video to match voiceover)

```

**Record 2-3 takes** (pick best in editing)

**Duration**: ~60 seconds of footage (will edit down to 30 seconds)

---

### SCENE 8: Stack List Command (Raw Footage)

**What to record**: Beautiful table of stacks

**Setup**:
1. Clean terminal (clear history)
2. Terminal zoomed to fill most of screen
3. Font size: 18pt minimum

**Recording**:
```bash
# Type slowly and deliberately
$ openconductor stack list

# Let the table appear fully
# Pause for 3 seconds (let viewers read it)
# Don't press any keys (hold the shot)
```

**Record 3 takes**:
- Take 1: Slow typing
- Take 2: Medium typing
- Take 3: Fast typing

**Duration**: ~15 seconds per take

---

### SCENE 11: The Install - Execution (Raw Footage)

**What to record**: The magic 10-second install

**Setup**:
1. Clean terminal
2. Timer app visible (optional: stopwatch app in corner)
3. Cursor ready to type

**Recording**:
```bash
# Take a breath, then type naturally
$ openconductor stack install coder

# Press Enter
# DO NOT TOUCH KEYBOARD OR MOUSE
# Let it run completely
# Let success message sit for 3 seconds
```

**Critical**:
- Record in **REAL TIME** (no speed up during recording)
- Record 5 takes (something might go wrong)
- Check that timer shows ~9-10 seconds

**Duration**: ~15 seconds per take (10s install + 5s buffer)

**Verify after each take**:
```bash
# Check that servers actually installed
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# You should see all 5 servers listed

# For next take, uninstall first:
openconductor stack uninstall coder
# Or manually remove from config
```

---

### SCENE 14: System Prompt Paste (Raw Footage)

**What to record**: Pasting system prompt into Claude

**Setup**:
1. Claude Desktop open
2. Settings → Custom Instructions open
3. Text field visible and empty
4. System prompt already in clipboard (from previous install)

**Recording**:
```
Action 1: Show empty Custom Instructions field
Action 2: Click in field
Action 3: Paste (Cmd+V or Ctrl+V)
Action 4: System prompt appears (long text)
Action 5: Scroll through it slowly (3 seconds)
Action 6: Scroll back to top
Action 7: Click Save button
Action 8: Confirmation appears
Action 9: Close settings
```

### SCENE 17: Real Usage Demo (Raw Footage)

**What to record**: Claude using the Coder Stack tools

**Setup**:
1. Claude Desktop with Coder Stack system prompt active
2. Fresh conversation
3. MCP server indicators showing 5 connected
4. Have a PostgreSQL database accessible (can be local test DB)

**Recording**:
```
User message (type this):
"Create a database migration for user authentication with OAuth support. Check our existing users table first."

[Press Enter]

[Wait for full response]

[Give 3 seconds at end for viewers to read]
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- This requires actual PostgreSQL MCP server working
- If you don't have a database, use a simpler demo:
  - "Search for React best practices and save findings to memory"
  - This uses Brave Search + OpenMemory (works without setup)

**Record 3 takes**:
- Claude's response might vary
- Pick the best one in editing

**Duration**: ~30-45 seconds per take

## 🎙️ Recording Session 2: Voiceover

**Duration**: 45-60 minutes
**Location**: Quiet room
**Equipment**: Best microphone you have

---

### Voiceover Setup

**Audacity Setup** (FREE):
```bash
# Install Audacity
# macOS
brew install --cask audacity

# Ubuntu
sudo apt install audacity

# Windows
# Download from audacityteam.org
```

**Recording Settings**:
1. Open Audacity
2. Select your microphone (dropdown at top)

### Recording the Voiceover

**Script**: [V1.2.0_PRODUCTION_SCRIPTS.md](V1.2.0_PRODUCTION_SCRIPTS.md) - VIDEO 1

**Process**:
1. **Slate each section**: "Hero Video, Scene 1, Take 1"
2. **Record section**: Read naturally, with energy
3. **Pause 3 seconds**: Silence between sections (easier to edit)
4. **Repeat**: "Hero Video, Scene 1, Take 2"
5. **Move to next section**

**Sections to record** (in order):
```
□ Scene 1: Cold Open (0:00-0:10)
□ Scene 2: Problem Setup (0:12-0:18)
□ Scene 3: Problem Details (0:18-0:30)
□ Scene 4: Transition (0:30-0:33)
□ Scene 5: Stacks Introduction (0:33-0:50)
□ Scene 6: Install Demo (0:50-1:15)
□ Scene 7: System Prompt (1:15-1:30)
□ Scene 8: Real Usage (1:30-1:50)
□ Scene 9: All Stacks (1:50-2:15)
□ Scene 10: CTA (2:15-2:30)
```

**Tips**:
- **Energy**: Enthusiastic but not over-the-top
- **Pacing**: Speak slightly slower than normal conversation
- **Emphasis**: Stress key words ("10 seconds", "zero configuration", "instant")
- **Breath**: Take breaths between sentences (edit out later)
- **Mistakes**: Don't stop if you mess up, just pause 2 seconds and re-read the sentence

**Record 2-3 takes per section** (pick best in editing)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Stack install fails during recording"
**Solution**: Test install beforehand, use `openconductor stack uninstall coder` between takes

### "Recording is laggy/choppy"
**Solution**: Close all other apps, lower OBS bitrate to 5000 Kbps, use QuickTime instead

### "I messed up the voiceover"
**Solution**: Just pause 2 seconds, re-read the sentence, keep recording

### "Claude's response is different than expected"
**Solution**: Record multiple takes, or guide the response with more specific query

### "System prompt didn't auto-copy to clipboard"
**Solution**: Manually copy from terminal output, paste in Claude (still looks good on camera)

### "I don't have a PostgreSQL database for the demo"
**Solution**: Use this alternative query instead:
```
"Search for Next.js 14 best practices, save the findings to memory, and create a checklist I can reference later."
```
This uses Brave Search + OpenMemory (no database needed)

**You've got this! Happy recording!** 🎥
